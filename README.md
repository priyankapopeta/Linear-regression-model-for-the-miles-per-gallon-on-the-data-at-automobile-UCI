Linear regression model for the miles per gallon on the data at automobile [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/).   Discard the categorical data.   Analyze the data to get relevant insight. Get feature matrix X, and target variable y. Split data into training and testing. Normalize data using MinMaxScaler. Creat a LinearRegression object for modeling.  Train the model with training data. Look at R^2 score for the goodness of fit for the train and test data.  Present a graphical comparison of true and observed responses for the test data.
